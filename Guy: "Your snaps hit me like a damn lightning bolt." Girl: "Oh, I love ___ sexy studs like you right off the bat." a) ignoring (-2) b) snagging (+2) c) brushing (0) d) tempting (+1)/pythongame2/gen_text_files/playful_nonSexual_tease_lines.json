  ["Are you staring at your screen because you’re reading my message, or because you’re trying to think of a smooth reply?", "A little bit of both, but mostly because I don’t want to stop talking to you."],
  
  ["If I sent you a wink emoji right now, would you blush or wink back?", "I’d wink back… while blushing, obviously."],
  
  ["Be honest, do you always text this smoothly, or am I just special?", "You’re definitely special… but I’ve got to keep my charm consistent."],
  
  ["If I asked you to describe me in three emojis, what would they be?", "🔥😍😏 (because you’re hot, adorable, and way too good at teasing me)."],
  
  ["What would you do if I stole your hoodie and sent you a selfie wearing it?", "Frame the picture, obviously… and then probably ask for a hug as payment."],
  
  ["If I suddenly stopped replying, how long before you start missing me?", "Like… two minutes, max. Maybe less if I was already thinking about you."],
  
  ["Would you still like me if I was a tiny gremlin who sent you memes at 3 AM?", "Honestly? I’d probably like you even more."],
  
  ["What if I told you I can read minds? Guess what I’m thinking about right now.", "Something about me, obviously. Hopefully something fun. 😉"],
  
  ["If I texted you ‘I’m trouble,’ would you still reply?", "I’d reply even faster. Trouble sounds fun when it’s you."],
  
  ["If I bet I could make you blush over text, would you take that bet?", "I’d lose instantly… but I’d enjoy it."],
  
  ["What would you do if I randomly texted ‘I’m bored’?", "Tell you that I’m great at fixing boredom… but you might end up blushing."],
  
  ["Would you rather have a deep late-night convo with me or just send each other flirty texts all night?", "Why not both? Deep convos with a side of flirting sound perfect."],
  
  ["If I started ignoring you for fun, how long before you break first?", "Not even five minutes… I’d do whatever it takes to get your attention back."],
  
  ["If I challenged you to a flirty texting battle, who’s winning?", "You are… but only because I’d be too busy smiling at my screen."],
  
  ["Do you think I’d be fun on a date, or do I have to prove it?", "Oh, I already know… but I’d still love the proof. 😉"],
  
  ["If I sent you ‘I’m cold,’ what’s your response?", "Either ‘I’m on my way’ or ‘steal my hoodie’—your choice."],
  
  ["What would you do if I sent you a text that just said ‘boo’?", "Pretend to be scared… but really just smile because you texted me."],
  
  ["If I stole a bite of your food, would you be mad?", "Nope, but I’d definitely steal one back. Fair is fair. 😏"],

  ["What would you do if I texted ‘come cuddle me’?", "Be there in five minutes—maybe less. 😏"],
  
  ["If I asked you to keep me entertained, what’s your first move?", "Well, I could tell you jokes… or just flirt with you until you blush."],
  
  ["If I randomly texted ‘I like you,’ what would you say?", "I’d say, ‘Took you long enough to admit it.’"],
  
  ["Would you rather send me a compliment or make me blush?", "Both. Because I want to see you flustered. 😏"],
  
  ["If I told you I have a soft spot for you, what would you say?", "I’d say I knew it… and I feel the same way. 😊"],
  
  ["If I stopped texting for an hour, would you notice?", "Notice? I’d probably send a ‘hey, don’t disappear on me’ text."],
  
  ["What would you do if I sent a winking emoji with no context?", "Panic a little, overthink it, and then flirt back anyway."],
  
  ["If I told you you’re kinda cute when you’re flustered, what would you do?", "Blush even harder and hope you don’t notice."],
  
  ["Do you think you can handle my texts?", "I don’t just think—I know I can. 😏"]
